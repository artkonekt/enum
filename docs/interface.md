# The Enum Interface

As of Enum v4.1 the `EnumInterface` has been added.

The base enum class implements it in a backwards-compatible manner.

The usage of the interface is fully optional, it's aim is to support scenarios
where specific enums are hinted with interfaces, and it serves as a common root
interface.
